# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

## Usage

Each solution contains an INPUT variable where the name of the input file is specified. Receive a unique input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Most days contain the following file structure:

```text
|- dayX
|   |- part1.py
|   |- part2.py
```

However some days contain the solutions to both parts in the same file (solution.py). In these cases, set the PART_1 variable accordingly (True for part 1, False for part 2).
